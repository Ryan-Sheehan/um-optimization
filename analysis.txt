Assembly Analysis:

The first thing we noticed was how many steps something simple
like BUArray_get was. It's a 3-line function, 2 of which were
assertions, and, yet, there was a lot of shuffling data between
registers and moving the stack (seemingly) uneccesarily. Plus
There were various calls to the function even though it wasn't
recursive!
Upon replacing the assertions with if statements, BUArray_get
went from 33 lines of assembly code to 14 lines.
Likewise, replacing assertions with if statements for all other
BUArray functions dropped the number of necessary assembly operations
by roughly 50%.
